//
//  Animation at the level of placed nodes.
//
//  Geometry: every node remembers the rect layout last gave it. When an
//  animated commit pass gives it a different one, it starts a
//  *displacement* — how far the new rect is from where the node was
//  showing — and each pass shows it at the rect layout gives *now* plus
//  that displacement, shrinking to nothing. Additive, so it converges on
//  whatever layout says even if that moves again mid-way.
//
//  What moves on screen is the leaves — shapes, colors, text, images —
//  each from its own old rect to its own new one, all on one curve.
//  A container is laid out at the new layout at once, and only its
//  *frame* (what hit testing and a clip see) is shown in between: were its
//  children laid out inside an in-between box, they would be squeezed
//  into a layout that is neither the old one nor the new one — a row of
//  buttons wrapping their labels — and a child would ride along with its
//  parent's motion on top of its own.
//
//  A leaf that fills its box (a shape, a color) is drawn at the sizes in
//  between; text keeps its new size and only its center travels, since it
//  would otherwise reflow at every frame.
//
//  Transitions: a structural container (`if`, `switch`, `ForEach`) notes
//  which of its children are new and which it lost. A new one draws under
//  its insertion effect until it arrives; a lost one — a ghost — is kept
//  among the container's children, out of layout and out of hit testing,
//  and drawn where it last stood under its removal effect until it is gone.
