//  The stack layout. Children are sized in flexibility order — least flexible
//  first — and a group only ever sees what the stricter groups left behind:
//  a `Spacer` gets leftovers, never a share. Within the content group each
//  child is offered its ideal extent when all of them fit, and an equal share
//  of what is left when they don't. That is what makes
//  `HStack { Text("a"); Spacer(); Text("b") }` put the texts at their natural
//  widths and give the rest to the spacer, rather than splitting the width
//  three ways. A node's flexibility is that of what it wraps (a stack: its
//  most flexible child), so a padded row of fixed frames is fixed too.
