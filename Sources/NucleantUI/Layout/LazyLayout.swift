//
//  LazyLayout.swift
//  NucleantUI
//
//  What makes `LazyVStack`, `LazyHStack`, `LazyVGrid` and `LazyHGrid` lazy.
//
//  The builder runs before layout, so a lazy container can't ask "what is
//  on screen?" while it builds. It keeps a *window* instead — the run of its
//  items that exist as views — in `@State`, and builds under it. Items are
//  counted in *units*: one per element of a `ForEach` whatever that element
//  flattens into, one per any other view. A `ForEach` reached through
//  nothing but transparent views (a `Group`, a `Section`, an `if`) builds
//  only the elements inside the window and stands a `LazyGapContent` in
//  for each run it skipped; everything else is built as usual.
//
//  Layout then sizes the gaps from the extents it measured for those units
//  before (or an average), finds which units fall inside the clip, and
//  moves the window when the clip is about to leave it. That write lands
//  like any other `@State` write: the next frame rebuilds the container,
//  and only it. The window reaches a viewport past the clip each way, so a
//  scroll is in built rows long before it would reach a gap.
//
//  A row's `@State` goes with it when it leaves the window, and its
//  `onAppear` runs again when it comes back — which is also what makes
//  "load more when the last row appears" work. Keep what must outlive the
//  scroll in a model.
