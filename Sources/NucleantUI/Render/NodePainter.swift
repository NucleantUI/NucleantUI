//
//  How the automatic per-view nodes get their pixels. They are the engine's
//  copy-target images (`RenderNodeManager.ImageEntry`) and own no canvas —
//  a fresh canvas costs tens of milliseconds whatever its size, a VkImage
//  microseconds — so they are filled through one shared canvas node, the
//  painter: at the end of a pass every image whose content changed is drawn
//  into the painter side by side (tallest first on shelves, a granule of
//  gutter between, so what a paint's anti-aliasing puts past its bounds
//  lands in the gap) and told where in it its content lies; the engine's
//  frame draws the painter and then, in list order, copies each region out
//  into its image. Turning one knob then rasterizes that knob, and nothing
//  else on screen.
//
//  The painter is a canvas node in the engine's list — never composited,
//  ordered before the images, as a `.shader` layer's canvas is before its
//  effect. The window's width; the window's height, or taller for a pass
//  that needs it. What does not fit even a painter at its tallest waits
//  for the next frame.
//
//  An image whose list changed in a few commands is repainted only where
//  they touch (`damage`): the commands reaching into that rect, cut to it,
//  copied into that region of the image.
