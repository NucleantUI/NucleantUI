    /// The node is repainted only when what the view draws changes: a state
    /// change elsewhere on screen leaves its image alone, and a state change
    /// inside it leaves the rest of the screen alone. Moving it (a scroll)
    /// costs nothing; resizing it retargets the canvas at a new image. The
    /// view keeps its layout, its input and its state — only where its
    /// pixels go changes.
    ///
    /// What is worth grouping: a subtree that changes often while the rest
    /// does not (a meter, a list of faders), or one that is expensive to
    /// rasterize and rarely changes. Every group costs an image the size of
    /// its frame, and a canvas the first time one appears; a `Text` in a
    /// hot row is not worth one.
    ///
    /// As for `.shader(_:)`, the node composites as a rectangle: clip
    /// *inside* the group (`.cornerRadius(10).drawingGroup()`), and a
    /// rotation outside it is cut at the image's edge. Whatever the
    /// enclosing view paints *after* this one and over it — a later
    /// sibling in a `ZStack` — is put in an image ordered after the node.
    ///
    /// A view that reads state gets a node of its own without this (see
    /// `RenderBoundaryContent`); a group is for a subtree that should be
    /// one image regardless, and owns a canvas for it.
