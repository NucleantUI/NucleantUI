//  `.contextMenu(menuItems:)`. The modifier marks a node with the items;
//  `ViewHost` opens the menu — on a right click, or a press held still on a
//  touch host — as an overlay above the tree, built from `ContextMenuOverlay`
//  below. Inside it a `Button` draws as a menu row, a `Menu` as a row that
//  opens a submenu beside it, and a `Divider` as a rule; choosing a row or
//  pressing anywhere outside closes it.
