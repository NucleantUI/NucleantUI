//  `.shader(_:)` — a view as a shader's texture input.
//
//  A `Shader` view *generates* pixels. This is the other direction: the view
//  it is applied to is drawn into a canvas of its own, and the shader reads
//  that canvas as a texture and writes the pixels that actually reach the
//  window — SwiftUI's `layerEffect`, on the engine's own terms. A canvas node
//  renders into its own VkImage, and `OGLShaderNode` takes texture inputs;
//  this is the view layer reaching both.
//
//  One modifier, whichever kind of function it is handed. A function with a
//  vertex stage gets the same texture at the same binding under the same name
//  (`uContent`, read with `layer(uv)`); its fragment stage runs over the
//  geometry the vertex stage places instead of over every pixel. The only
//  extra it takes is what a graphics draw cannot infer — how many vertices
//  and instances.
//

extension View {

    /// Runs `function` over this view's rendered pixels.
    ///
    /// Inside the body the view is `uContent`, a `sampler2D` stored y-up like
    /// the rest of shader space, and `layer(uv)` reads the view's pixel under
    /// the current one — so `fragColor = layer(uv);` is the identity, and a
    /// distortion is `layer(uv + offset)`. ShaderToy's `iChannel0` is the
    /// same texture, so a post-processing shader written against it drops in
    /// through `ShaderFunction(shaderToy:)` unchanged.
    ///
    /// The view keeps its layout and its input: a fader under a ripple is
    /// still a fader. What the effect changes is only what is drawn, and it
    /// composites as a rectangle over the canvas — so clip *inside* the
    /// effect (`.cornerRadius(10).shader(fx)`), where the rounding lands in
    /// the texture, rather than outside it.
    ///
    /// A `function` with a vertex stage — `isGraphics` — is drawn instead of
    /// dispatched, and everything above still holds: same texture, same name,
    /// same `layer(uv)`, same `ShaderArgument`s. What changes is which pixels
    /// the fragment body runs over. A per-pixel function covers the rect, so
    /// leaving `fragColor` alone leaves the view on screen; a vertex stage
    /// shades only what its triangles cover, and the rest of the rect is
    /// cleared. So a glow drawn over a view is one more instance, not one
    /// fewer:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// view.shader(glow, arguments: [.float4Array("touches", touches)],
    ///             vertices: 6, instances: touches.count + 1)
    /// ```
    ///
    /// with instance 0 the full-view quad returning `layer(uv)` — the
    /// identity — and the rest the glows. `vertices` and `instances` are
    /// ignored by a per-pixel function, and are per-frame values otherwise:
    /// changing them redraws without a rebuild.
    ///
    /// `isEnabled: false` draws the view as usual, keeping its identity and
    /// state so an effect can be toggled without rebuilding what is under it.
    ///
    /// `backdrop: true` draws what was already painted under this view's
    /// rect — everything earlier in paint order, in the same window or
    /// layer — into the texture before the view itself, so `layer(uv)`
    /// reads the view *and its background*: a glass or blur over whatever is
    /// beneath. The window's clear colour and other shader nodes are not
    /// paint, so they are not in it.
    ///
    /// `arguments` are the shader's named inputs — see `ShaderArgument`.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - vertices: with a vertex stage, vertices per instance; 6 is a quad
    ///     as two triangles.
    ///   - instances: how many times the vertex stage runs over them.
