//
//  A `Shader` view does not draw into the shared window canvas — it cannot,
//  the canvas is a 2D vector surface. It gets its own GPU node, composited
//  into its own rect of the swapchain, which is what `RenderContainerNode`'s
//  `compositeRect` is for.
//
//  That means slots have a *lifetime tied to the view tree*: created when a
//  Shader view first appears, moved and resized as it is laid out, destroyed
//  when it goes away. This registry is that bookkeeping, and the one place in
//  the framework where the view layer reaches the engine directly.
//
//  A `.shader(_:)` effect is the same slot with one more piece: a canvas
//  of its own that the view is drawn into, bound to the compute
//  shader as a texture. Two engine nodes, then — the canvas, which is never
//  composited, and the effect's output, which is — updated in that order.
//
//  A `VertexShader` view is the same slot again with a graphics pipeline in
//  place of the compute one: its image is a colour attachment drawn by a
//  render pass, and composited exactly like the others.
//
//  The canvases themselves — a `.shader` layer's, the per-view nodes of
//  `.drawingGroup()`, and `ThorCanvas`'s — are `RenderNodeManager`'s, which
//  this registry owns and drives through the same pass lifecycle; layers and
//  drawing groups share one pool of the build's canvases (`CanvasBackend`). Slots and nodes are composited in the order
//  the tree placed them (`nextPaintOrder`), not the order they were built.
