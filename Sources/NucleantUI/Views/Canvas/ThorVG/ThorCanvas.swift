import NucleantThorVG

/// A view drawn by two closures against its own ThorVG canvas.

/// ```swift
/// ThorCanvas(
///     onInit: { context, size in          // once per node: add the paints
///         let rect = TCShape()
///         rect.append_rect(pos: .zero, size: size)
///         rect.set_fill_color(r: 255, g: 255, b: 255)
///         context.add(shape: rect)
///         shapes.rect = rect
///     },
///     renderer: { context, size in        // whenever what it read changed,
///         shapes.rect.append_rect(…)      // or the size did
///     }
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The node is the view's for as long as the view stands: `onInit` runs when
/// the node is created, on a canvas holding nothing, and `renderer` after it
/// — then again on every rebuild of this view and on every resize (the
/// canvas is retargeted, the paints survive), after which the node is
/// rasterized. A `@State` read through a captured binding, or an
/// `@Observable` property read, inside `renderer` makes this view depend on
/// it: a change rebuilds this view alone and runs `renderer` again. Nothing
/// read changes ⇒ nothing runs ⇒ the node keeps its image.
///
/// `id` is the "start over" handle: a different value is a new node — a
/// fresh canvas, `onInit` again. Sizes are canvas pixels; the view takes
/// whatever space it is offered, so give it a `.frame` — one no bigger than
/// the window, which is as large as a node's image can be composited.
