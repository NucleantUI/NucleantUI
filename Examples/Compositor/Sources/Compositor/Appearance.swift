//
//  Appearance.swift
//
//  A System / Light / Dark switch, the same in every example, as a View
//  menu in the menu bar. "System" hands down the scheme the window was
//  seeded with — which follows System Settings as it changes — and the
//  other two fix one. The menu writes the choice to `AppearanceModel`; the
//  root view reads it and applies the result with `.colorScheme(_:)` under
//  itself, so every dynamic color in the app resolves against it.
